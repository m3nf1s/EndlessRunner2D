# EndlessRunner2D
## Тестовое проект на Unity3D

Need to create a simple runner with interactions with the game environment.

The idea of the game: the player takes control of any playable object (square, circle, drawn man - does not matter) which rolls in a straight line from the left side of the screen to the right. The goal of the game is to jump from platform to platform, avoiding an abyss (that is, in fact, jumping over them). The jump is carried out by a simple tap on the screen. The race should be endless, plus there should be a platform counter at the top of the screen so the system counts the number of platforms completed.

The key feature is in the following - platforms come in two colors (say, blue and red). In order for the player to move around the platform it must be the same color as the platform itself. If a player sees in front of him a platform of a different color - he must change the color of the playable object. To change the color double tap is used on the screen (thus, the color must be changed already in the jump to the next platform).


The race should be endless. If the player touches the platform that does not match its color, or falls into the abyss - the game is over. When game is over the player is shown the number of platforms passed and the Replay button (start over).


Any assets can be used in this task - use free assets from free stocks, or objects drawn in a paint, does not matter.
